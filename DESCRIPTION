Description: Performs statistical tests to compare coefficients and residual 
    variance across multiple models. Also provides graphical methods for 
    assessing heterogeneity in coefficients and residuals. Currently supports 
    linear and generalized linear models, as well as 'lmer' and 'glmer' models 
    from the 'lme4' package and 'svyglm' and 'svyolr' models from the 'survey' 
    package. Reference: Li (2015) <https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/3985/>.
