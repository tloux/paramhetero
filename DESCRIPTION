Description: Performs statistical tests to compare coefficients and residual 
    variance across multiple models. Also provides graphical methods for 
    assessing heterogeneity in coefficients and residuals. Currently supports 
    linear and generalized linear models, as well as their multi-level and 
    complex survey-weighted variations from the 'lme4' and 'survey' packages, 
    respectively. Reference: Li (2015, ISBN: 9781339132600).
