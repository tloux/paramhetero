\title{Compare single regression coefficient across models.}
\usage{
coef_welch(bs, vars, ns, p)

coef_anova(bs, vars, ns, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{bs}{Vector of regression coefficients.}

\item{vars}{Vector of variances of estimates in \code{bs}.}

\item{ns}{Vector of sample sizes for each model.}

\item{p}{Single integer, number of shared predictors in models.}
}
\value{
Vector containing the resulting F statistic, numerator degrees of
  freedom, denominator degrees of freedom, and the p-value for the test of
  equality.
}
\description{
Compare the regression coefficients of a predictor across models.
}
\details{
Both \code{coef_anova} and  \code{coef_welch} compare the coefficient of
a predictor across multiple models, testing the null hypothesis that all
parameters are equal. \code{coef_anova} assumes heterogeneity across models,
while \code{coef_welch} allows for heterogeneity in the natural variation.
Currently, only \code{coef_welch} is implemented as it is a slightly more
generally applicable test. An option for \code{coef_anova} may appear in
later versions.

For example, given three models

\begin{align}
y_i &= \beta_{10} + \beta_{11}x_{i1} + \beta_{12}x_{i2} + \beta_{1i} \\
y_i &= \beta_{20} + \beta_{21}x_{i1} + \beta_{22}x_{i2} + \beta_{2i} \\
y_i &= \beta_{30} + \beta_{31}x_{i1} + \beta_{32}x_{i2} + \beta_{3i}
\end{align}

Would test hypotheses $H_0: \beta_{11} = \beta_{21} = \beta_{31}$ against
the alternative that not all three parameters for $x_1$ are equal. (Or
similarly for the parameters of $x_2$.)

This is the workhorse function for \code{\link{coefficient_anova}}.
